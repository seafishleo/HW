### Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
- The climate in Hawaii whenever in summer or winter are merely the same.
- The standard deviation is only 3.25 and 3.7, so we can say that the temperature each day in between June and December is almost the same.
- The average temperature in June is around 75F, December is around 71F. 

## Summary: 
### Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
- The data provides 7 years of temperature and precipitation records that can be used in the weather prediction. The standard deviation is only 3.25 and 3.7, so we can infer that any day between June and December is a hot day. We also can use the temperature and precipitation datasets to calculate the humidity. With the humidity data, we can discover further on the climate difference between summer and winter.
