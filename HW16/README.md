-- The percentage of 5-star reviews on Vine program is 42.41% which is slightly lower than the non-Vine program of 42.41%. The result shows that the Vine review is not a positive factor for evaluating the quality of feedback. On the other hand, maybe the sample is not enough to conclude the analysis.
