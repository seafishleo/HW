# Employee Database challenge

## Overview of the analysis

### Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis is using the SQL statements to query and create new tables. Analyzing the results of queries of retiring employees and the mentorship program participants.

## Results:
### Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed:
-- Comparing the percent eligible retirees to their titles, it will affect the Engineering department the most which could potentially affect their ability to do research and development.  
-- 30.13% of the eligible retirees could retire at any time.  
-- Total number of eligible mentorships will barely cover the gap of the eligible retirees.    
-- If the company will compensate the lost by training from withing, the analyst will need to widen the search parameter.  

## Summary:
### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
-- There were approximately 90,398 needed to filled and mitigate the "silver tsunami" impact ahead of time.  Training employees could take more time so measuring their productivity without going through the mentorship or training could severely impact research and development.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
![GITHUB](https://github.com/seafishleo/HW/blob/master/HW7/2.png)  
-- From the query provided above, there are 29,414 Senior Engineers, 28,254 Senior Staffs and 4,502 Technical Leaders who are retirement-ready employees and can mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees.
